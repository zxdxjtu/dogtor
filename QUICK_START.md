## üí° Tips for Best Results

### Health and Safety
- **Start Gradually**: Begin with 15¬∞ angles and 10-minute intervals
- **Listen to Your Body**: Reduce intensity if you feel discomfort
- **Stay Consistent**: Regular small exercises are better than infrequent large ones
- **Combine with Breaks**: Use rotations as reminders to take full breaks

### Optimization Tips
- **Peak Hours**: Set more frequent rotations during intensive work periods
- **Angle Selection**: Larger angles (20-30¬∞) for stronger exercise, smaller (10-15¬∞) for subtle reminders
- **Smart Scheduling**: Use working hours feature to avoid rotations during personal time
- **Indicator Usage**: Keep indicators on initially to build awareness, then disable for less distraction

### Workplace Integration
- **Team Awareness**: Let colleagues know about potential screen rotations during meetings
- **Presentation Mode**: Disable before important presentations or screen sharing
- **Dual Monitors**: Extension works best on primary monitor content
- **Break Coordination**: Sync rotation intervals with existing break schedules

### Performance Optimization
- **Tab Management**: Extension works on active tab only, so organize your workflow accordingly
- **Memory Usage**: Close unused tabs to ensure smooth animations
- **Regular Updates**: Keep the extension updated for latest performance improvements
